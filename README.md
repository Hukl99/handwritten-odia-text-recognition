# handwritten-odia-text-recognition
This project is a deep learning-based system to recognize handwritten Odia (ଓଡ଼ିଆ) characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Keras, it processes scanned character images and classifies them into their respective Odia script labels.
